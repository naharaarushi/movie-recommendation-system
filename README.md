🎬 Movie Recommendation System

📌 Project Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques. It suggests movies to users based on similarity patterns derived from movie features. The system analyzes user preferences and movie metadata to provide personalized recommendations, improving the overall user experience.

⚙️ Technologies Used
     Python
     Pandas
     NumPy
     Scikit-learn
     Jupyter Notebook
     NLP
     
🧠 Approach
The recommendation system is based on content-based filtering. It uses features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew to calculate similarity between movies. Cosine Similarity is applied to measure how closely related two movies are, and recommendations are generated accordingly.

📊 Output
Recommends a list of similar movies based on the selected movie
Uses similarity scores to rank recommendations

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to build intelligent recommendation systems. It can be further enhanced by integrating user ratings, collaborative filtering, or deploying it as a web application.
